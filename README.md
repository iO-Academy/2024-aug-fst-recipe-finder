This is the front-end of project 7. This project required both a front end and back end. The tech stack chosen was MERN.

Minimum Viable Product:
The goal of the project is to produce an app that allows a user to create an account with an email address and then login and add their own recipes.
Once the recipe is added, the user can then add cooking instructions, ingredients, cooking and preparation time one by one.
The ingredients need to auto-complete so that ingredients are not duplicated and to help the user quickly add ingredient data.

Further functionality:
#- The ability to filter recipes by available ingredients.
#- Mark ingredients as optional
#- Show incomplete recipes where 75% of the ingredients are present the corresponding recipes will be shown.
#- Share recipes/Make recipes public.
